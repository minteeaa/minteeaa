### about

I'm a developer of a few different languages and talents, none of which are exactly mindblowing, but I attempt to make an appeal to whoever I work with.

- ðŸ”­ does **discord bots**, **front-end**, **graphic design**, and some other things
- ðŸŒ± currently learning **C#**, and how to escape a coffee addiction
- ðŸ“« contact me on twitter [@minteaseu](https://twitter.com/minteaseu), discord @ `mintea#0001`, [or join my server](https://discord.gg/xraYxJt)
- ðŸ˜„ pronouns: entity
- âš¡ fun fact: squirrels will die from starvation rather than terminal velocity in fall

### other notes

If you can read, you can probably tell I use JavaScript a lot. While this may be true (and it is), I am quite well versed in HTML, CSS (or SCSS or SASS), I can use TypeScript if needed, and I have a history in graphic design, albeit that's less obvious here. I'm experimenting with other languages, mainly C# right now, but in the future I'm hoping to have a wider variety to show for.

I make most of my projects open-source, especially the bigger ones I've taken on. It's time consuming, and next to my day-to-day life, can be pretty hard to consistently contribute to a lot of these projects. Despite this, I am quickly stumbling along in this path of development that I hope I might be able to turn into a career one day. No pain, no gain, right?

### support

I do most of my commissions and work for very low prices (and most times, free), so I take what I can get. 

* [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/minteaseu) - if you'd like to randomly donate to my coffee/extra food fund
* [my website](https://mintea.pw/) - if you'd like to see what I can do, and maybe request something done

Thanks for checking my profile out!
